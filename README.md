## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

- **REST API:** All task operations are exposed via `/api/tasks` endpoints, following RESTful principles.
- **Entity Modeling:** JPA entity (`Task`) with repository pattern for clean data access.
- **Frontend State:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state and side effects.
- **CORS & Security:** Fine-tuned CORS and open security for development, easily extendable for production.
- **Componentization:** Separation of concerns with dedicated components for forms, lists, and layout.
- **Testing Ready:** Structure supports easy addition of unit and integration tests.

## 🧪 Testing & Deployment

- **Backend:**
  - Run `mvn test` for unit/integration tests (expandable for more coverage).
- **Frontend:**
  - Run `npm test` for React component tests.
- **CI/CD:**
  - Ready for integration with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI/CD tools.
- **Deployment:**
  - Easily deployable to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, Azure) with minimal changes.
