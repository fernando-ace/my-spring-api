---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Node.js 18+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker

---

### 1. Set Up PostgreSQL with Docker

**Start PostgreSQL in Docker:**

```sh
docker run --name my-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:16
```

**Update the backend configuration** in `src/main/resources/application.properties` if you need to change credentials:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
```

> **Note:** If you are running TaskFlow in a Codespace or cloud environment, you may need to set the backend (8080) and/or database (5432) ports to public in your environment settings to allow external access from the frontend or your local machine.

---

### 2. Start the Backend

```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

---

### 3. Start the Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Example Usage

- **Add a Task:** Enter a title and click "Add Task".
- **Edit/Delete:** Use the edit and delete buttons next to each task.
- **Mark Complete:** Check the box to mark a task as done.

---

## Architecture

- **REST API:** All task operations are exposed via `/api/tasks` endpoints.
- **Entity Modeling:** JPA entity (`Task`) with repository pattern for clean data access.
- **Frontend State:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state and side effects.
- **CORS & Security:** Fine-tuned CORS and open security for development.
- **Componentization:** Dedicated components for forms, lists, and layout.

---

## Testing

- **Backend:** `mvn test` for unit/integration tests.
- **Frontend:** `npm test` for React component tests.

## Configuration for Any Environment

To make TaskFlow work in any local, Codespaces, or cloud environment, configure the frontend and backend URLs as follows:

### Frontend
1. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env`.
2. Set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` to your backend URL:
   - For local: `http://localhost:8080/api`
   - For Codespaces: `https://<your-codespace-id>-8080.app.github.dev/api`

### Backend
1. Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
2. Set `app.cors.allowed-origins` to your frontend URL(s), comma-separated if multiple:
   - For local: `http://localhost:3000`
   - For Codespaces: `https://<your-codespace-id>-3000.app.github.dev`

> This allows anyone to run TaskFlow in their own environment without code changesâ€”just update the environment variables and properties!
