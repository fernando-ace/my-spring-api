# TaskFlow: Modern Full-Stack Task Manager

> **Effortless productivity, engineered for the modern web.**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

TaskFlow is a full-stack task management application designed to streamline personal productivity and showcase best practices in modern software engineering. Built with a robust Java Spring Boot backend and a sleek React + Tailwind CSS frontend, TaskFlow demonstrates clean architecture, RESTful API design, and seamless user experience. 

**Problem Solved:**
Managing daily tasks can be overwhelming without the right tools. TaskFlow provides a simple yet powerful interface for creating, editing, and tracking tasks, making it easy to stay organized and productive. The project also serves as a reference implementation for scalable, maintainable, and testable full-stack applications.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Usage

![TaskFlow UI Screenshot](TaskFlow_UI.png)

- **Add a Task:** Enter a title and click "Add Task".
- **Edit/Delete:** Use the edit and delete buttons next to each task.
- **Mark Complete:** Check the box to mark a task as done.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

- **REST API:** All task operations are exposed via `/api/tasks` endpoints, following RESTful principles.
- **Entity Modeling:** JPA entity (`Task`) with repository pattern for clean data access.
- **Frontend State:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state and side effects.
- **CORS & Security:** Fine-tuned CORS and open security for development, easily extendable for production.
- **Componentization:** Separation of concerns with dedicated components for forms, lists, and layout.
- **Testing Ready:** Structure supports easy addition of unit and integration tests.

---

## üß™ Testing & Deployment

- **Backend:**
  - Run `mvn test` for unit/integration tests (expandable for more coverage).
- **Frontend:**
  - Run `npm test` for React component tests.
- **CI/CD:**
  - Ready for integration with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI/CD tools.
- **Deployment:**
  - Easily deployable to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, Azure) with minimal changes.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- MySQL support (PostgreSQL is now default)
- User authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth)
- Real-time updates (WebSockets)
- Advanced filtering, sorting, and search
- Mobile-first enhancements
- Comprehensive test coverage

## üêò PostgreSQL Setup in Codespaces

**Recommended: Use Docker for PostgreSQL in Codespaces**

1. **Stop any system PostgreSQL service (if running):**
   ```sh
   sudo service postgresql stop
   ```
2. **Start PostgreSQL in Docker:**
   ```sh
   docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
   ```
3. **Update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:**
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
   spring.datasource.username=postgres
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```
4. **Check your database:**
   ```sh
   docker exec -it my-postgres psql -U postgres -d mydatabase
   ```
   Then in the psql prompt:
   ```sql
   \dt
   SELECT * FROM task;
   \q
   ```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see `address already in use`, stop the system PostgreSQL service or use a different port for Docker.
- If you see CORS errors, update your backend CORS config to allow your frontend's Codespaces URL.
- For Codespaces, always use Docker for a clean, user-controlled PostgreSQL instance.
